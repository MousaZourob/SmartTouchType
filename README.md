# Smart Type Assistant
Smart Type Assistant allows users to improve their touch typing skills (such as WPM and accuracy) by generating new prompts based on the letters they make mistakes on. For example, if the user keeps making mistakes with the letters 'T', 'R', and 'Q', new unique prompts will be generated that have words containing these letters, allowing the user to improve on their weaknesses. It also shows the user their accuracy and WPM live while they're typing the new prompt so that they can see how well they're doing and track their progress. Built using **Python** and **Tkinter GUI** for **MLH Same Home Different Hacks 2020 hackathon**.
